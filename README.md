# Daily Covid Tracker

> My Application works with this [API](https://covid19tracking.narrativa.com/index_en.html), which gives me data about covid cases that can be filtered with a date range, by a specific day, by country, and more. I'm getting data about 194 countries for the current date (today), I separate the countries into continents and the user can surf through the links that I create to view more info about the evolution of the disease for the countries and regions of that countries.

Basic UI of the project:
